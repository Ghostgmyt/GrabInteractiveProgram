GRAB Fare & ETA Estimator
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This is a simple C++ program that estimates Grab ride fares and ETAs.
It is part of our assignment to translate the innovation model into logic/code and demonstrate testing & debugging for a smooth user experience.

The program asks the user for ride details (distance, time, demand, supply, tier, service type, and tolls), applies surge pricing, tier discounts, and calculates an estimated fare.

ðŸ›  Features

Interactive Q&A style input.

Validates all inputs (rejects letters, out-of-range values, etc.).

Handles tolls (asks if applicable, accepts decimal values).

Applies surge pricing based on demand/supply and peak hours.

Applies loyalty tier discounts (Basic, Silver, Gold).

Outputs fare, tolls, and total clearly formatted.

Provides a small tip/recommendation at the end.

ðŸ“Š Example Run
=== GRAB Fare & ETA Estimator ===
Enter trip distance in km (0.5 - 100): 7
Enter the hour of the day (0 - 23): 18
On a scale of 1 to 10, how high is the demand? 9
On a scale of 1 to 10, how many drivers (supply) are available? 3
Choose your tier (1 = Basic, 2 = Silver, 3 = Gold): 2
Choose service type (1 = Standard, 2 = Pool): 1
Are there any toll charges? (y/n): y
Enter toll charges (RM): 2.50

--- Fare Result ---
Service       : Standard
Distance (km) : 7
ETA (minutes) : 19
Surge         : x2.25
Tier Discount : 7%
Ride Fare     : RM 38
Toll Charges  : RM 2.50
Estimated Fare: RM 40.50
Tip: POOL may be cheaper now due to high surge on a short trip.

ðŸ§ª Testing & Debugging

Tested with valid inputs and invalid ones (letters, out-of-range values).

Program now re-prompts for wrong input instead of crashing.

Handles tolls correctly as decimals.

Ensures smoother user experience for assignment requirements.

ðŸ“Œ Notes

This is a student-level program, simplified for assignment use.

Logic and pricing are approximations and not official Grab fares.

Git commit history shows incremental development (inputs â†’ surge logic â†’ toll handling â†’ error handling).
